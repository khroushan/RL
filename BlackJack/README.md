### Black-Jack Game
The Black-Jack game is an easy and good example to study for Reinforcement Learning.

#### List of file
- `BlackJack_stateValue.ipynb`: the return for each state is
evaluated using Monte Carlo algorithm to regenerate the result in Fig
5.1 of ref()
- `BlackJackMC.ipynb`: To solve the Black-Jack problem and find the
optimal policy, Monte Carlo with exploring start (ES) algorithm has
been used. The goal is to regeberate Fig. (5.2) in ref()
